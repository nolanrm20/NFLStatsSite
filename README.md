<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>As of now, this site will just output some statistics of the Philadelphia Eagles based on the users selection of position 
(RB, QB, WR). The short term goal is to create clean looking tables to compare the teams 2017 stats to their 2018 in all
categories. Long term, we'll work to add functionality for all NFL teams to do the same.</p>
<p>The site retrieves data from <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/data-feeds/">My Sports Feeds API</a> and updates 
using AJAX, showing the user a table with the stats they requested once the data is returned.</p>
